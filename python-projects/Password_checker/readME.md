A Python tool that evaluates password security by analyzing multiple factors and providing a comprehensive strength score with actionable feedback.

Features
Multi-factor analysis: Checks length, complexity, and common patterns

Strength scoring: Rates passwords from 0-100 with clear strength categories

Detailed feedback: Provides specific suggestions for improvement

Security-conscious: Uses getpass to hide input by default

Common password detection: Flags weak and frequently used passwords

Pattern recognition: Identifies sequences, repeats, and keyboard patterns
