🔐 Advanced Password Strength Checker
A robust Python utility that thoroughly evaluates password security using multiple validation layers, providing a detailed strength assessment with actionable recommendations.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Comprehensive Security Analysis
Case-sensitive evaluation: Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters

Length verification:

Minimum 8 characters required

12+ characters recommended

16+ characters for strong passwords

Character diversity check:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Special characters (!@#$%^&*, etc.)

⚠️ Security Risk Detection
Common password flagging: Checks against top 10,000 worst passwords

Pattern recognition:

Sequential characters (123, abc)

Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdfgh)

Repeated characters (aaa, 111)

Breach detection: Optional HIBP API integration (checks against known breaches)

📊 Scoring System
100-point scale with 5 strength tiers:

90-100: Excellent

75-89: Strong

50-74: Good

25-49: Weak

0-24: Very Weak

🔒 Password Analysis Results:

Strength: Excellent (94/100)
Length: 14 characters (✓ meets recommendation)
Character Diversity: 4/4 types (✓ excellent)
Unique Characters: 12/14 (✓ good variety)

Security Checks:
✓ No common patterns detected
✓ No keyboard sequences found
✓ Not found in known breaches

Recommendations:
- Consider making your password even longer (16+ characters)
- You might add a few more special characters
